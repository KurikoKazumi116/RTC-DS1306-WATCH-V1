# RTC-DS1306-WATCH-V1
V1 OF MY RTC-DS1306 WATCH

Hello, this is my first ever planned out physical project (BESIDES THE CLOCK), I made this to be as simple as possible to make sure I didn't short or mess anything up. But as this is the VERSION 1 series, I'll be updating this project.


COMPONENTS USED

    3.7V LIPO battery
    OLED SSD1306 display
    TP4056 Lithium battery charger module (with protection)
    Arduino Micro Pro 
    RTC DS-1307 tiny 
    A watch case 
    A switch

I used Arduino IDE and its code, you'll need the download the #import libraries that I noted for it to work.

CURRENTLY IT HAS THE ABILITIES OF
    
    Time + Current time greeting (eg. Good Evening/Morning)
    Temperature
    A booting screen
