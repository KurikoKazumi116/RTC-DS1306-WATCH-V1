## 10/20/2025 - Gathering materials and making designs  

### DAY 1-4
Gathering the needed materials took some time. I decided to not make a PCB because I wanted it to fit a certain case I had and make it just a soldering project. 

I bought/used (GOT THESE OFF ALIEXPRESS LOL)

1. 3.7V LIPO battery
2. OLED SSD1306 display
3. TP4056 Lithium battery charger module (with protection) 
4. Arduino Micro Pro (This could be switched for a smaller microcontroller, like XIAO esp32)
5. RTC DS-1307 tiny (IF A XIAO IS USED, THIS WONT BE)
6. A watch case (I had an old Casio watch frame lying around)
7. A switch (For off and on)

Then I made a drawing of how to connect all the components in a sketchbook. **_(Sorry its really messy, Ill redraw this at a later date)_**

...and made the whole thing on WOKWI to make sure it actually worked.

After making sure I have the project well thought/drawn out, I decided to make sure the stuff will fit into the case, and create the code to the watch. Now it has the basics of...
1. Time + Current time greeting (eg. Good Evening/Morning)
2. Temperature
3. A booting screen

Since now I've finished the code, I'll continue brainstorming what else to add to the watch, I'm considering adding a laser or some sort of flashlight, a stop watch, and a simple game on it that uses only one button. I am also thinking of cutting down the components to save space.
